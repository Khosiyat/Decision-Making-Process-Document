# GitHub Code Review and Workflow Guidelines

To ensure a smooth and efficient code review process, as well as a streamlined workflow for our development team, we've established the following guidelines:

## Branch Management:

1. **Create Branches for Every Change or Feature:**
   - For every change or new feature, create a new branch. This ensures that each change is isolated and can be reviewed independently.
   - Naming convention for branches should be descriptive and indicative of the change or feature being worked on.

2. **Merge Before Push:**
   - Before pushing any changes to a shared branch, ensure that your changes have been merged successfully with the latest version of the target branch.
   - This helps in avoiding conflicts and maintains the integrity of the codebase.

## Workflow:

1. **Avoid Direct Commits to Main/Develop Branch:**
   - We agreed not to commit directly to the main or develop branch.
   - Administrators are not exempt from this rule. Even as administrators, it's crucial to follow the established workflow.

2. **Code Reviews:**
   - All changes must go through a code review process.
   - To facilitate code reviews, do not push directly to the develop branch. Instead, push changes to feature branches.

3. **Maintain a Working Version in Develop Branch:**
   - The develop branch should always have a working version of the application.
   - Developers should be able to see and interact with the application in this branch.

## Workflow Steps:

1. **Pull Before Push:**
   - Every time you want to make a change, pull the latest changes from the target branch.
   - This ensures that you're working on the most up-to-date version of the codebase.

2. **Create New Branches for Changes:**
   - When starting work on a new change or feature, create a new branch from the target branch.
   - Work on this branch separately and avoid directly modifying the develop branch.

3. **Merge and Push:**
   - Once your changes are complete and have been reviewed, merge them into the target branch.
   - After merging, push the changes to the remote repository.

## Additional Notes:

- **Code Review Comments:**
  - Ensure that comments and feedback from code reviews are addressed before merging changes.
  - Reviewers should provide clear and constructive feedback to help improve code quality.

- **Documentation:**
  - Document any significant changes, including reasons for modifications, to ensure transparency and clarity for all team members.

By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to maintain a clean and organized codebase, minimize conflicts, and facilitate effective collaboration within our development team.
